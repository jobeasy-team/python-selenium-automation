#Given a string, determine if it consists of all unique characters.
#For example, the string 'abcde' has all unique characters and should return True.
#The string 'aabcde' contains duplicate characters and should return False.

print('cde' in txt1)
print('abcde' in txt1)
print('a' in txt1)
print('abc' in txt1)
