    <h4><b> Instructions</b></h4>
        <ol>
            <b>
            <li>Cut the whole chickens into 4 breasts, 4 thighs, 4 legs and 4 wings and set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oil, in either a heavy pan on the stove or a deep-fryer, to 325 degrees F.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder
                <br>
                and cayenne pepper until thoroughly mixed. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Pour the buttermilk into another bowl large enough for the chicken to be immersed in the buttermilk.</li>
            <li>Prepare your dredging station. Place your chicken in a bowl. Next to that, your bowl of buttermilk,
                <br>
                 and next to that, your dry mixture.</li>
            <li>Take your breasts, lightly dust them with your flour mixture, then dip them in the buttermilk
                <br>
                until they are coated, and then place them in the flour mixture.</li>
            <li>Take the breasts that are in the flour mixture and aggressively push the flour mixture
                <br>
                into the wet chicken. Make sure that the chicken in very thoroughly coated, or you will not achieve
                <br>
                the crust and crunch you are looking</li>
            <li>Next, repeat the dredging steps with your other pieces of chicken in this order: thigh, leg then wing.</li>
            <li>When you place the last wing into the fryer, you should have 16 pieces of chicken in the oil.
                <br>
                Set a timer for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 15 minutes, take a probe thermometer and check the temperature of a breast. If it reads 180 degrees F,
                <br>
                all of your chicken is done. (Keep in mind that it will continue to cook after it has been
                <br>
                removed from the fryer.)</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the oil and let it drain for 5 minutes. Let cool for an additional
             <br>
                10 minutes before serving.</li>
